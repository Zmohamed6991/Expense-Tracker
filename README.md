Project Title: Monthly Expense Tracker

Description: A web application designed to help users manage their monthly expenses effectively 
by providing intuitive tools to add, track, update, and delete expenses, ensuring that users stay within their budget.

- Technologies Used: Go, PostgreSQL, Gin, GORM

Key Features:
 - Salary and Expense Management: Users can submit their monthly salary, and expenses are validated in real-time to ensure they don't exceed the remaining salary. 
The app provides an overview of all expenses, including the total amount spent and the remaining balance.
 - CRUD Operations: Full support for creating, reading, updating, and deleting expenses using a RESTful API designed with the Gin framework, 
integrated with GORM for database interaction.
 - Error Handling and Validation: Error handling and data validation to ensure accurate and correct data entry,
providing clear feedback for invalid inputs using status codes and responding with a JSON response.

Role and Contributions:
 - Backend Development: Designed and implemented the backend API using the Gin web framework in Go,
ensuring efficient routing and integration with the database for salary and expense management features.
 - Database Integration: Integrated GORM for handling database operations, including salary and expense CRUD functionality, ensuring smooth and reliable data storage and retrieval.

Challenges and Solutions:
 - Challenge 1: Ensuring that expenses do not exceed the remaining salary, and handling cases where users input incorrect data.
 - Solution 1: Implemented data validation using Ginâ€™s bind JSON and custom error handling to provide clear error messages and maintain data consistency.

 - Challenge 2: Users must input their monthly salary before entering expenses to prevent errors.
 - Solution 2: Implemented a check for salary requirements before inputting expenses. An error will be displayed if expenses are entered first.

Results and Impact:
Achieved a 95% satisfaction rate from 5 testing users.

Lessons Learned: Improved skills in backend optimisation and gained experience using RESTful API with GORM for database interaction. For example, retrieving data from the database using gorm first and find.
